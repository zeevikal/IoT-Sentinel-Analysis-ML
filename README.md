# Unveiling IoT: Harnessing ML for Device Identification through Network Traffic Analysis


## Introduction

As of 2023, the world has witnessed exponential growth in the number of IoT devices, revolutionizing the way we live and work. With approximately 15 billion connected IoT devices, nearly double the global population, it is imperative to address the security and management challenges posed by this ever-expanding ecosystem. Our research project, "Unveiling IoT," is dedicated to enhancing IoT security through machine learning-driven network traffic analysis for device identification.

## Research Overview

In this repository, we present the culmination of our work, which builds upon the foundation laid by the article titled ["IOT SENTINEL: Automated Device-Type Identification for Security Enforcement in IoT."](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.04880.pdf) Our research introduces six additional features that significantly improve the accuracy and reliability of IoT device classification based on network traffic patterns.

## Key Objectives

Our primary objectives in this research project include:

1. **Enhanced Device Classification**: We aim to improve the accuracy of IoT device classification using network traffic analysis.

2. **Feature Engineering**: We introduce novel features that contribute to better device identification.

3. **Transparent and Reproducible Research**: We provide a clear and detailed explanation of our methodology to ensure transparency and reproducibility in the research community.

4. **Future Directions**: We discuss potential avenues for further development in IoT security.
